 Continued..
 This is the same as in bosschallenge1 - yt5 BUT! Now, we are going to do this
 in a while loop! To recap what we want to do

 Ask the user if his birthday, Tell him to write yes or no.
 Save the answer to a string variable.

 Now check the answer

 Yes:
    Tell him you're sorry you missed it -> EXIT WHILE LOOP
 No:
    Ask if you are invited. -> EXIT WHILE LOOP
 Neither
    Tell him him he needs to run the program again.

 HINT: if, else if, else and .toLowerCase(), break, while
