 Now, wrap a while true loop around these conditions, and only exit the while
 loop if the user behaves and writes the correct year.

 IMPORTANT: Think hard about what variable do we need to have access after the
 while loop is finished. What is our next task after the while loop?


 For reference, the conditions were:

 If both condition1 and condition2 are true:
  subtract the year the user entered from the result from step4
  As usual, print what operations you are performing.
  --> EXIT THE WHILE LOOP!
 Else:
  User is a fool, exit the program
