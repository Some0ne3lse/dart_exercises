 Now, we simply need to parse the results from step5. We want to capture the
 first digit and then the last two digits, in two separate variables.
 String firstDigit and String age.

    Hint:
      It's hard to fetch sub digits from an integer, convert the step5 results
      to string first, then capture the digits!
    Hint:
      You want to get sub-string, There is a method (The . menu) for
      String variables that allows you to access a portion of a String.

 When you have the variables, you can do something like

 print('In the beginning you chose the number $firstDigit');
 print('I think you are $age years old.');
 print('Thank you for playing.');
