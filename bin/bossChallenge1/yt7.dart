 Create yet another if sentence, ask the user when he was born.
 Store the result first in a String variable. Now, create two bool variables
 and one int variable

 bool condition1;
 int decade;
 bool condition2;

 Condition1:
    Check if the length of the string from the user equals to 4.
    Hint:
      You can save boolean results from conditions statements, for example
        int step0 = 6;
        bool condition = step0 <= 10;
    Hint:
      Given a string, what property (The . menu) can you use to determine the
      length of said string?


  Decade
    Fetch the decade from the year string and store it as a integer.
    Hint:
      You want to get sub-string, that is, the first two digits of the year
      string and convert it to a integer. There is a method (The . menu) for
      String variables that allows you to access a portion of a String.


  Condition2:
    This condition should be true, IF decade is EITHER 19 or 20.

 After this, print the results like this

 print('Year: $year');
 print('Length is 4: $condition1');
 print('Decade: $decade');
 print('Decade is valid: $condition2');

 And verify it works.
